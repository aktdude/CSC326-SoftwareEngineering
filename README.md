# iTrust2-v11
This was a project developed in CSC326(Software Engineering) that mocks a hospital application.<br>
This work was done by previous semesters and then during my semester was added onto even more by our team of 5 including:<br>
Alex Taylor<br>
Srinath Vasudevan<br>
Pavan Gandhi<br>
Jeffrey Zeng<br>
Roman Peace<br>

We added all information relevant and dealing with the Patient Advocate, which was a role on this mock website that assists patients who either may not be able to do certain things on their own, or are assigned an advocate for other reasons. We also added functionality for Appointment Requests in multiple areas of the website.
