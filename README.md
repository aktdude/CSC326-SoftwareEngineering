# iTrust2-v11
Important! All class work was based off of https://github.com/ncsu-csc326/iTrust2 <br>
Much of the code contained here is created by those listed above. We made only contributions related to Patient Advocates and Appointment Requests(described below) <br>
This was a project developed in CSC326(Software Engineering) that mocks a hospital application.<br>
This work was done by previous semesters by a multitude of NCSU students and then during my semester was added onto even more by our team of 5 including:<br>
Alex Taylor<br>
Srinath Vasudevan<br>
Pavan Gandhi<br>
Jeffrey Zeng<br>
Roman Peace<br>

We added all information relevant and dealing with the Patient Advocate, which was a role on this mock website that assists patients who either may not be able to do certain things on their own, or are assigned an advocate for other reasons. We also added functionality for Appointment Requests in multiple areas of the website.

The project is meant to be ran in Eclipse as a Maven Project. You also have to edit the application.yml folder based on the template.
It should run on the following URL:
http://localhost:8080/iTrust2
