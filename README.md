# iTrust2-v11
This was a project developed in CSC326(Software Engineering) that mocks a hospital application.
This work was done by previous semesters and then during my semester was added onto even more by our team of 5 including:
Alex Taylor
Srinath Vasudevan
Pavan Gandhi
Jeffrey Zeng
Roman Peace

We added all information relevant and dealing with the Patient Advocate, which was a role on this mock website that assists patients who either may not be able to do certain things on their own, or are assigned an advocate for other reasons.
